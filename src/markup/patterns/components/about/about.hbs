    <p class="c-about__copy o-grid__third">Our journey began in 2011 when illustrator Ryan Clark drew an owl in the iconic style of mid-century modern illustrator Charlie Harper for his soon-to-be sonâ€™s new nursery. Then he kept drawing &#8212; and drawing. Today, a Modern Eden is an artful line of toys and decor centered around 40+ unique animal illustrations.</p>
    <p class="c-about__copy o-grid__third">Discover a world where education mixes with play. Where amazing antelopes, buzzing bumble bees, clever cheetahs, and delightful dolphins come together to create a learning experience artistically adorned in classic comtemporary decor.</p>
